            <h1>Education</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I’m currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Economics.
                Originally, I started as an Economics major, but after taking a computer science course, I fell in love with the field. 
                One course that especially captivated me was Data Structures and Algorithms, so much so that I now serve as a UTA for the class. 
                After graduation, I plan to pursue a career in computer science, with the intention of returning to school someday for my master’s degree. 
                Outside of academics, I’m actively involved in the Computer Science Club, the Bodybuilding Club, and the business technology fraternity, 
                Kappa Theta Pi.

                Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Federated Hermes, an investment management firm located in Downtown Pittsburgh, responsible 
                for managing $830 billion in assets. During my time there, I worked with two teams: the Data & Analytics team and the Data Enterprise team. 
                On the Data & Analytics team, I built analytical models using Power BI and manipulated data from JSON files. 
                On the Data Enterprise team, I took on a Data Engineer role, creating ETL pipelines to streamline data processes within the company. 
                Additionally, I participated in a company-wide hackathon and developed a Power BI project that was estimated to save the company $95,400 annually.

            <p> If I hadn’t pursued computer science, I likely would have majored in Exercise Science. Outside of class, 
                I’m passionate about working out and have spent a lot of time researching efficient ways to build muscle. 
                In addition to fitness, I enjoy cooking, golfing (still trying to not slice), and spending quality time with my family and friends.
